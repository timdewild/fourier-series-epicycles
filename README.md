# Fourier Epicycles Animation
In these animations, we give a different interpretation to (complex) Fourier series in terms of rotating vectors in the complex plane. This gives a completely new way of looking at Fourier series. We will also show how we can make 2D 'Fourier drawings' using this interpretation. 

## The Complex Fourier Series
For a function $f(t)$ with period $P$, i.e. $f(t) = f(t+P)$, the complex Fourier series is given by:
```math
\begin{equation*}
    f(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty} c_n\; e^{i2\pi n t/P}
\end{equation*}
```
